# Regime-Conditioned Machine Learning Trading System

A research-grade equity trading engine than detects market regimes and conditions predictive machine learning models on regime-specific dynamics to handle financial non-stationarity

## Motivation

Financial markets are non-stationary,: relationships between features and returns change across volatility, liquidity, and macro regimes. Global predictive models often fail when regime structure is ignored

This project explores a regime-aware approach to equity prediction, combining unsupervised regime detection with conditional machine learning models to improve robustness and risk-adjusted performance

## System Overview

The system is composed of four core layers:
1. Data ingestion and feature engineering
2. Market regime detection
3. Regime-conditioned predictive modelling
4. Portfolio construction and evaluation

## Project Roadmap

### Phase 1 - Data Pipeline

**Status:** Implemented data processing, working on feature engineering

A production-ready data pipeline that ingests, cleans, and aligns mixed-frequency macro time series data for regime detection.

**Data Sources:**
- Macro indicators: VIX, Treasury yields, Fed indices (NFCI, CFNAI), inflation (PCE), industrial production, jobless claims
- Frequency: Daily (VIX, yields), weekly (NFCI, claims), monthly (economic indicators)
- Period: 2000-01-03 to present (~26 years, 6,500+ business days)

**Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Load**: Combine raw parquet files from source directory
2. **Select & Clean**: Filter to configured series, handle weekend releases, deduplicate
3. **Align**: Align to US business day calendar with staleness tracking
4. **Validate**: Comprehensive quality checks (types, ranges, gaps, outliers)
5. **Save**: Export processed data ready for feature engineering

**Key Features:**
- **Staleness tracking**: Distinguishes new vs forward-filled data points for proper feature engineering
- **Mixed-frequency handling**: Safely aligns daily, weekly, monthly data without look-ahead bias
- **Business day calendar**: Excludes weekends and US market holidays
- **Automated validation**: Detects duplicates, nulls, outliers, temporal inconsistencies

**Output:** `data/processed/macro_processed.parquet` - aligned, validated time series ready for regime detection

**Next Steps:** Feature engineering (transforms, z-scores, moving averages) respecting native frequencies

### Phase 2 - Regime Detection

- Unsupervised regime inference (eg. HMMs, clustering)
- Volatility and correlation-based regime definitions
- Regime stability and transition dynamics

### Phase 3 - Regime-Conditioned Models

- Separate predictive models per regime
- Tree-based baselines, followed by neural models
- Probabilistic outputs and uncertainty estimates

### Phase 4 - Portfolio and Evaluation

- Risk-aware signal aggregation
- Transaction cost modeling
- Regime-aware performance attribution
